        The key characteristic of a local identifier. A specific subset of keys is predefined, but additionally any other custom key is allowed. Predefined keys (to be used when applicable):
        - "manufacturerId" - The Business Partner Number (BPN) of the manufacturer. Value: BPN-Nummer
        - "jisNumber" - a number that is used to identify the call-off that can be assumed unique within the specific just-in-sequence process. This is typically not the sequence number, but the call-off number.
        - "jisCallDate" the date of the just-in-sequence call-off as stated on the call-off document itself. Value: following the ISO 8601 format as follows: "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss" or "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm"
        - "parentOrderNumber" - a number identifying the just-in-sequence- part's destination parent part. The parent part is typically known upfront to the supplier for just-in-sequence parts. This might be a temporary unique identifier.
        Not all keys might be relevant for all just-in-sequence parts. It must be ensured that a combination of these identifiers and the optional manufacturer part ID or customer part ID leads to a unique just-in-sequence part.
