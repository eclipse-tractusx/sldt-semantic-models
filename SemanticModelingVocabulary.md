# As a part of Harmonisation of semantic models, this file contains the commonly used semantic modeling vocabulary. This vocabulary is chosen by scanning all the present semantic models. Identified vocabulary is the one which is used mostly by many semantic models. So, instead of creating definition every time within the semantic model, we can fix a common definition/understanding for these identified business vocabulary.
## This is the initial stage of improving the business vocabulary. please feel free to improve or add more to it.
