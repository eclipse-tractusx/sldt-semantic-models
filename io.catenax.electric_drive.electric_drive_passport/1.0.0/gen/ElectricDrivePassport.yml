Classes of performance may be based on single parameters, on aggregated scores, in absolute terms or in any other form that enables potential customers to choose the best performing products. Those classes of performance shall correspond to significant improvements in performance levels. Where classes of performance are based on parameters in relation to which performance requirements are established, they shall use as the minimum level the minimum performance required at the time when the classes of performance start to apply.
