        The Digital Product Passport (DPP) allows to share process and product-related information amongst supply chain businesses, authorities and consumers. The DPP allows for efficient information flows following best practices; and the possibility of accompanying the measures under this Regulation with mitigating measures so that impacts are expected to remain proportionate for SMEs.This is expected to increase transparency, both for supply chain businesses and for the general public, and increase efficiencies in terms of information transfer to support the data exchange between economic actors in integrating circularity in product design and manufacturing.
        In particular, it is likely to help facilitate and streamline the monitoring and enforcement of the regulation carried out by EU and Member State authorities. It is also likely to provide a market-intelligence tool that may be used for revising and refining obligations in the future.
        The DPP includes data about components, materials and chemical substances, information on repairability, spare parts, environmental impact and professional disposal for a product.
        The data model will be updated, as newer versions of the regulation will be published.
        This data model is based on the proposed Ecodesign Regulation ("Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products and repealing Directive 2009/125/EC" ESPR from March 30th, 2022 with some additional data points which can be found in the adopted Amendments from July 12th 2023 (Amendments adopted by the European Parliament on 12 July 2023 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for setting eco-design requirements for sustainable products and repealing Directive 2009/125/EC).
