   samm:description "The Digital Product Passport (DPP) allows for the sharing of process- and product-related information among supply chain businesses, authorities, and consumers. The DPP allows for efficient information flows following best practices, and the possibility of accompanying the measures under this Regulation with mitigating measures so that impacts are expected to remain proportionate for SMEs. This is expected to increase transparency, both for supply chain businesses and for the general public, and increase efficiencies in terms of information transfer to support the data exchange between economic actors in integrating circularity in product design and manufacturing. In particular, it is likely to help facilitate and streamline the monitoring and enforcement of the regulation carried out by EU and Member State authorities. It is also likely to provide a market-intelligence tool that may be used for revising and refining obligations in the future. The DPP includes data about components, materials, and chemical substances, information on reparability, spare parts, environmental impact, and professional disposal for a product, and many other information related to the data.\nThe data model will be updated, as newer versions of the regulation will be published and new regulations for product groups will be published. The main basis is provided by the document: Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for sustainable products, amending Directive (EU) 2020/1828 and Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and repealing Directive 2009/125/EC. and achieving the aims of the  Communication of Circular Economy Action Plan. The generic model can also be used to provide information about packaging."@en ;
